# Addidas-US-Data-Analysis

I worked on the Adidas US Sales Dataset that I got from hashtag#Kaggle and I created my first dashboard based on this dataset in Excel. I was able to gather some insights from the dataset which goes thus:
ðŸ”¹       The Total Sales from 2020-2021 - $899,902,125
ðŸ”¹        The Sales Trend from the year 2020-2021
ðŸ”¹       The Top Selling Product â€“ Menâ€™s Street Footwear
ðŸ”¹        The Top Selling Retailer -West Gear
ðŸ”¹       Maximized Sales Price; that is the price that drove the highest sales- $50.
ðŸ”¹         The Top Sales by Region- The West
ðŸ”¹        The Top Sales Method- Instore
ðŸ”¹        The Operating Profit derived from the Sales Method; that is the sales method that generates the highest Operating Profit-Instore
ðŸ”¹        The Operating margin derived from the Sales Method; that is the sales method that generates the highest Operating Margin-Online Store
ðŸ”¹       The Profit Margin for 2020-2021
Key Problem Derived from the Dataset:
ðŸ”¸       Based on the insights derived from the above dataset, it was discovered that the Online Stores generates 28% but has the highest operating margin and generates low operating sales.
To Explain the problems better, when a company has a good operational margin but a bad operating profit, it typically means that the company's operating expenses are too high relative to its revenue. In other words, the company is generating a reasonable gross margin, but its operating costs are eating up a significant portion of that margin, resulting in a low operating profit.
Recommendation
To address the above issue, I would recommend;
ðŸ”»       Reducing operational expenses
ðŸ”»       Improving Cost Management
ðŸ”»       Increasing Revenue
ðŸ”»       Re-evaluating the Pricing Strategy
I am always open to corrections and collaborations.
